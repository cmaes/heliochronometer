  <h2>The Heliochronometer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><p>A <span><strong>heliochronometer</strong></span> is a
    sundial that tells <span><strong>standard mean
    time</strong></span> by computing a correction
    from <span><strong>local real time</strong></span> via a
    mechanical mechanism.</p>
    </li>

    <li><p>Standard mean time is the time we use in everyday life,
    where all hours have the same length regardless of the
    season. Regular sundials tell local real time which is determined
    directly by the motion of the sun (when the sun is at its highest
    it is noon in local real time).</p>
    </li>

    <li><p>The heliochronometer uses information such as the
    observer’s latitude and longitude, the position of true north, as
    well celestial mechanics and an astronomical formula
    called <span><strong>the Equation of Time</strong></span> to
    compute standard mean time.</p></li>
  </ul>


  <h2>History of the heliochronometer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The heliochronometer was invented by James Gibbs around
        1906</p>
      <img src="gibbspatentheader.png" width="600px"/>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The heliochronometer solved the need to set mechanical
        wristwatches all over England to Greenwich mean time</p>
      <img src="gibbshelio.png" width="600px"/>
    </li>
    <li><p>Gibbs partnered with William Pilkington to produce the <span><strong>Pilkington &amp; Gibbs Heliochronometer</strong></span></p></li>
    <li><p>Less than a thousand Heliochronometers were made, of which about fifty exist today</p></li>
    <li><p>Original Heliochronometers are still accurate today, over a hundred years later</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why build a heliochronmeter today?</h2>
  <p id="helioquote">The heliochronometer is an elegant mechanical device. It is
  more than a simple machine. It is a device to mark the hours, an
  optical instrument, and a mechanical computer. Embedded within the
  heliochronometer is the motion of our plant around the sun. Its body
  is aligned with the cardinal directions and its angles tuned to this
  location. When you align the sight with the sun’s rays you begin to
      understand the place you occupy in our solar system.</p>

  <h2>The anatomy of the modern helichronometer</h2>
  <img src="labeledhelio.png" width="600px"/>
  </div>
  <div id="background2">
  <h2>How does the heliochronometer tell time?</h2>
  <p>To compute standard mean time the heliochronometer makes use of
    several pieces of information: the observer’s latitude, the hour angle
    of the sun, the observer’s longitude, the direction of true north, the
    month of the year, and the declination of the sun.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>To tell the time the heliochronometer needs to be able to
    precisely located the sun within a reference coordinate
    system</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>The heliochronometer uses the Equatorial coordinate
        system. The sun is located via two angular
        measurements <span class="math"><em>τ</em></span>
        and <span class="math"><em>δ</em></span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>The hour angle <span class="math"><em>τ</em></span> is
            the angle between the meridian and the star measured on
            the equator</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>The declination <span class="math"><em>δ</em></span> is
            the angular distance from the equator</p>
          <img src="equatorial.png" width="400px">
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The angle stands that support the dial have been manufactured
    so that the dial lies in a plane parallel to the equator. The
    angle <span class="math"><em>ω</em></span> is the colatitude
    and <span class="math"><em>ϕ</em></span> is Palo Alto’s
    latitude <span class="math">37.43<sup>∘</sup></span>.
      </p>
      <img src="latangle.jpg" width="300px">

    </li>

    <li>
      <p>The base of the dial is rotated so that the angle stands are
    aligned with the meridian. The smaller block faces toward north
    and the larger block faces south.</p>

      <img src="northsouthalignment.png" width="300px">
    </li>

    <li><p>When the sight is rotated so that the sun’s light travels
    through the pinhole in the front sight and hits the center of the
    back sight the pointer measures the
    angle <span class="math"><em>τ</em></span></p>
      <p><img src="dialcenter.png" alt="image" /></p>
    </li>

    <li><p>The angle <span class="math"><em>τ</em></span> is
        proportional to the local real time</p>
      <img src="tauangle.png" width="600px"/>
    </li>

    </ul>
    </div>
  <div id="background1">
  <h2>Converting local real time to standard mean time</h2>
  <h3>Longitude and Time Zones</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The earth is divided into time zones each
    approximately <span class="math">15<sup>∘</sup></span> degrees
    of longitude wide</p></li>

    <li><p>Under standard mean time the time within a time zone is
    that of a reference meridian. For the Pacific Time Zone the
    reference meridian is
    at <span class="math">120<sup>∘</sup></span> W Longitude. Palo
    Alto is at <span class="math">122<sup>∘</sup></span> W
    Longitude.</p></li>

    <li><p>From the perspective of an observer west of the reference
        meridian the sun appears to be slow by four minutes per degree
        of longitude</p>
      <img src="longitude.png" width="600px"/>
    </li>

    <li><p>To adjust for this effect the dial is rotated by the
    longitudinal offset from the reference meridian and locked into
        place with the circumference screw</p>
      <img src="circumferencescrew.png" width="600px"/>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Daylight Savings Time</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>From March to November clocks are adjusted forward one hour
    for Daylight Savings Time. To adjust for DST the dial is
    rotated <span class="math">15<sup>∘</sup></span>. The longitudinal
    offset is then based off the daylight savings time mark rather
    than the standard time mark.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Equation of Time</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The Equation of Time is an astronomical formula for the
        difference between local real time and standard mean time over
        the course of the year</p></li>

    <li><p>The difference is due to two effects: the eccentricity of
    the Earth’s orbit and the obliquity of the Earth’s rotational
    axis</p>
      <img src="meansun.png" width="960px"/>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Analemma</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The engraving on the back sight is a curve called
    the <span><strong>analemma</strong></span> that adjusts for the
    equation of time</p></li>

    <li><p>The vertical axis is the sun’s negated
    declination <span class="math">−<em>δ</em></span></p></li>

    <li><p>The horizontal axis is the correction from local real to
        standard time due to the equation of time</p>
      <img src="analemmamayallblack.png" width="600px">
    </li>

    <li><p>To compute standard mean time rotate the sight so that the
    beam of light is centered on the portion of the analemma
        corresponding to the current month of the year</p>
      <img src="solardot.jpg" width="300px"/>
    </li>

    <li><p>The analemma can also be seen by taking a picture of the
        sun each day at noon over the course of a year</p>
      <img src="analemmasun.jpg" width="300px"/>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Design</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The design of the heliochronometer is based entirely off
    the 1906 and 1911 patents, a 1923 sundial construction treatise,
    and pictures of similar bespoke heliochronometers made by two
    modern craftsmen</p></li>

    <li><p>A significant amount of the design work involved reverse
    engineering these previous heliochronometers</p></li>

    <li><p>The sights and pointer were designed using numerical
    optimization. A nonlinear program with ten variables and ten
    constraints was used to find a design that maximized the distance
    between the two sights, subject to constraints imposed by the
    analemma, the width of the pointer and the inner radius of the
    dial.</p></li>

    <li><p>A complete CAD model of the heliochronometer was
        constructed including each of the eight hidden fasteners.</p>
      <img src="assemblyscreenshot3.png" width="300px"/>
      <img src="assemblyscreenshot4.png" width="300px"/>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Nine brass parts were manufactured on the milling machine,
    rotary table and lathe: the dial plate, the dial support plate,
    the tall latitude angle stand, the short latitude angle stand, the
    front sight, the back sight, the pointer, the concentric rotation
    half threaded rod, and the base plate</p></li>

    <li><p>Two additional acrylic parts were constructed for
    fixturing: a <span class="math">37.43<sup>∘</sup></span> angle
    block for machining the latitude angle stands, and a alignment
    plate for engraving the dial. These were made on the
    LaserCAMM.</p></li>

    <li><p>The most difficult parts to manufacture were the dial plate
        and the hidden concentric rotation half-threaded rod</p></li>

    <li><p>The dial plate was manufactured on the rotary table. It
    took several session to machine and had to fixtured and centered
        before each session</p>
      <img src="dialrotarytable.jpg" width="600px"/>
    </li>

    <li><p>The half-threaded rod that enables concentric rotation of
    the dial and sight was difficult to machine due to its small size
        and its internal and external threads</p>
      <img src="concentricrodcollet.jpg" width="600px"/>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Engraving</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The engravings on the dial and back sight were done by Tom
        and Cathy Nyren of Tanner’s Engraving in San Jose</p></li>

    <li><p>The nose cone of the CNC engraver rides on the surface of
    the workpiece</p></li>

    <li><p>The engraving tool extends .005” below the cone and into
        the workpiece</p></li>
