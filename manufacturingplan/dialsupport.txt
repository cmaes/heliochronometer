Dial Support 


1. Procure Material for Dial Support
   - one piece of 6'' x 1'' x 1/4'' brass plate
   - rough sawn on the band saw

2. Mill Piece to Overall Dimensions 

   Notes: 
   - measure dimension with workpiece in vice 
   - be sure operations result in mutually perpendicular edges
   - be sure cutter is rotating in proper direction 
   - do NOT run cutter into vise or parallels !!!
   - use a file and filecard to deburr rough edges 
   - always clean collet and spindle before mounting tool 


   A. Mill ends to dimension 
      - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' end mill 
      - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
      - maximum depth of cut = 0.025'' 
      - position work in vise on parallels 
      - remove parallels before machining
      - feed by hand... slow, steady feed leaves a good finish 
      - deburr when finished

   B. Mill sides to dimension
      - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' end mill 
      - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
      - position vise on parallels 
      - remove paralled before machining 
      - deburr when finished

3. Drill and tap #4-40 hole 
   A. Edge find center of workpiece
      - coat center of workpiece with Dykam
      - use edge finder in keyless chuck to locate center 
      - clockwise rotation of milling machine handwheel will move the table AWAY from you (right hand rule)
      - stop feed once edge-finder jumps, or it will break
      - radius of edge-finder is 0.100'' 
      - spindle speed ~= 800 RPM
  
   B. Center drill hole 
      - remove edge-finder and insert center drill 
      - spindle speed ~= 1400 RPM 
      - lock down ways 
      - drill staring hole with center drill
   
   C. Drill blind hole 
      - remove center drill 
      - insert 1/8'' drill into keyless chuck and drill workpiece using pecking technique
        with knee, not quill 
      - spindle speed ~=u 1400 RPM 
      - drill to depth of .157'' with knee
         
   D. Tap threads 
      - use #4 - 40  tap with tap handle 
      - taps break vey easily and are expensive, so be careful 
      - tapping is done by hand with power off 
      - put tap in the tap handle 
      - use a center in a collet mounted in the spindle to align tap over hole 
      - use Tap Magic to lubricate cut 
      - turn tap handle 3-4 turns while applying slight pressure with the quill 
      - next, after each 1/2 turn of cutting, back the tap out 3/4 of a turn 
        to break the chip, being sure to release pressure on the quill while doing so. 
        Continue advancing the tap until the through hole has been tapped. Remeber that too much 
        pressure can break the tap, and a broken tap is near impossible to remove from a part. 



4. Drill and tap 1/4-20 hole 
   A. Center drill hole 
      - insert center drill 
      - spindle speed ~= 1400 RPM 
      - lock down ways 
      - drill staring hole with center drill
   
   C. Drill through hole 
      - remove center drill 
      - insert 1/4'' drill into keyless chuck and drill workpiece using pecking technique
        with knee, not quill 
      - spindle speed ~=u 1400 RPM 
  
   D. Countersink hole 
      - remove 1/8'' drill and insert countersink for #4-40 screw
      - spindle speed ~= 250 RPM 
      - countersink shoulders just touches workpiece and Dykam disappears
         
   E. Tap threads 
      - use #4 - 40  tap with tap handle 
      - taps break vey easily and are expensive, so be careful 
      - tapping is done by hand with power off 
      - put tap in the tap handle 
      - use a center in a collet mounted in the spindle to align tap over hole 
      - use Tap Magic to lubricate cut 
      - turn tap handle 3-4 turns while applying slight pressure with the quill 
      - next, after each 1/2 turn of cutting, back the tap out 3/4 of a turn 
        to break the chip, being sure to release pressure on the quill while doing so. 
        Continue advancing the tap until the through hole has been tapped. Remeber that too much 
        pressure can break the tap, and a broken tap is near impossible to remove from a part. 

5. Drill 1/2'' through hole 
   A. Drill through hole 
      - insert 1/4'' drill into keyless chuck and drill workpiece using pecking technique
        with knee, not quill 
      - spindle speed ~=u 1400 RPM 


6. Drill and tap 1/4-20 hole 
   A. Center drill hole 
      - insert center drill 
      - spindle speed ~= 1400 RPM 
      - lock down ways 
      - drill staring hole with center drill
   
   C. Drill through hole 
      - remove center drill 
      - insert 1/4'' drill into keyless chuck and drill workpiece using pecking technique
        with knee, not quill 
      - spindle speed ~=u 1400 RPM 
  
   D. Countersink hole 
      - remove 1/8'' drill and insert countersink for #4-40 screw
      - spindle speed ~= 250 RPM 
      - countersink shoulders just touches workpiece and Dykam disappears
         
   E. Tap threads 
      - use #4 - 40  tap with tap handle 
      - taps break vey easily and are expensive, so be careful 
      - tapping is done by hand with power off 
      - put tap in the tap handle 
      - use a center in a collet mounted in the spindle to align tap over hole 
      - use Tap Magic to lubricate cut 
      - turn tap handle 3-4 turns while applying slight pressure with the quill

        Continue advancing the tap until the through hole has been tapped. Remeber that too much
