Dial Support Angle 2


1. Procure Material for Dial Support Angle 2
   - one piece of  5.5'' x 1'' x 1/2'' brass plate
   - rough sawn on the band saw

2. Mill Piece to Overall Dimensions 

   Notes: 
   - measure dimension with workpiece in vice 
   - be sure operations result in mutually perpendicular edges
   - be sure cutter is rotating in proper direction 
   - do NOT run cutter into vise or parallels !!1
   - use a file and filecard to deburr rough edges 
   - always clean collet and spindle before mounting tool 


   A. Mill ends to dimension 
      - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' endmill 
      - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
      - maximum depth of cut = 0.025'' 
      - position work in vise on parallels 
      - remove parallels before machining
      - feed by hand... slow, steady feed leaves a good finish 
      - deburr when finished

   B. Mill sides to dimension
      - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' endmill 
      - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
      - position vise on parallels 
      - remove paralled before machining 
      - deburr when finished

2. Mill Angled Side 
   A. Mill angled side 
      - use Dykem to mark .5'' side
      - position piece in vise on 52.57 degree angled block
      - use 3/4'' or 5/8'' end mill 
      - spindle speed ~= to 1200 RPM
