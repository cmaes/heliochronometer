Dial 

1. Procure Material for Dial 
   - one piece of 8'' x 8'' x 1/4'' brass plate 
   - rough sawn on the band saw 

2. Mill Piece to Overall Dimensions 

   Notes: 
   - measure dimension with workpiece in vice 
   - be sure operations result in mutually perpendicular edges
   - be sure cutter is rotating in proper direction 
   - do NOT run cutter into vise or parallels !!!
   - use a file and filecard to deburr rough edges 
   - always clean collet and spindle before mounting tool 


   A. Mill ends to dimension 
      - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' end mill 
      - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
      - maximum depth of cut = 0.025'' 
      - position work in vise on parallels 
      - remove parallels before machining
      - feed by hand... slow, steady feed leaves a good finish 
      - deburr when finished

    B. Mill sides to dimension
       - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' end mill 
       - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
       - position vise on parallels 
       - remove paralled before machining 
       - deburr when finished

3. Prepare workpiece for Lathe 
   A. Use edge-finder to locate center of workpiece
      - use edge finder in keyless chuck to locate center 
      - clockwise rotation of milling machine handwheel will move the table AWAY from you (right hand rule)
      - stop feed once edge-finder jumps, or it will break
      - radius of edge-finder is 0.100'' 
      - spindle speed ~= 800 RPM
  
   B. Drill center through hole
      - remove edge-finder and insert 1/2'' end mill
      - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM
      - do not drill into vise or parallels 

3. Turn outside diameter  
   A. Mount workpiece in lathe 
      - use scrap piece in 3-jaw chuck 
      - place dead center in through hole 
   B. Turn outside diameter
      - spindle speed ~= 400 RPM (never turn 
      3-jaw chuck more than 1000 RPM) 
      - do not reposition workpiece between operations 
      - use single point, zero rake, right hand lathe tool
      - set tool at correct angle for turning - feed will be 
        from right to left 
      - use auto feed: first become familiar with feed levers
      - engage feed gearbox using feed direction selector 
      - set gearbox to about .004 in/rev using chart, feed selector and fee selector dial 
      - position longitudinal/cross feed selector to longitudinal feed
      - to verify the machine is set correctly, use longitudinal wheel and cross feed handle to position carriage far 
        away from all obstacles 
      - turn on the spindle and make sure the feed box is turning. 
      - when the feed bar is turning, engage the auto-feed engaging lever. 
      - depth of cut is measured on the crossfeed micrometer dial 
      - maximum depth of cut 0.010'' 
      - turn stock down to a diameter of 8'' 
4. Bore inside Diameter 
   - bore radius out to 7'' and a depth of .125'' -- see drawing
   - spindle speed ~= 400 RPM 
   - use internal single point boring bar and cut on the inside surface closest to 
     you so the material is moving down onto the tool 
   - make sure spindle is turning in the correct direction 
   - if you get loud screeching, or your workpiece is not cutting well, you may be 
     experiencing chatter
   - measure with calipers to check your work as it progressses, remembering that each cut on 
     the inside INCREASES the diameter! 

5. Chamfer Internal Diameter and Outside Diameter 
   - spindle speed ~= 400 RPM 
   - use single point, zero rake, left hand tool positioned at about 
     a 45 degree angle to axis of part 
   - cut both chamfers with the same tool setup as follow: rotate the 
     spindle towards you and cut at the front of the part for the outer chamfer. 
     Rotate the spindle away from you and cut on the back of the part for the inner chamfer. 
     
6. Cut 60 degree Arc through hole
   - remove dial from lathe 
   - procure rotary table 
   - position dial on rotatry table with table center through dial center
   - use center-finder in keyless chuck 
   - use center-finder to locate outer diameter of the dial 
   - use center-finder to locate the inner diameter of the dial
   - split the difference to position tool at radius of 3.75''
   - zero DRO 
   - lock ways 
   - remove center finder and insert 1/8'' end mill
   - cut 60 degree arc in dial by rotating table 
   - maximum depth of cut .025''
