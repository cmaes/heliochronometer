Backsight 


1. Procure Material for Backsight
   - one piece of 4'' x 1'' x 1/4'' brass plate
   - rough sawn on the band saw

2. Mill Piece to Overall Dimensions 

   Notes: 
   - measure dimension with workpiece in vice 
   - be sure operations result in mutually perpendicular edges
   - be sure cutter is rotating in proper direction 
   - do NOT run cutter into vise or parallels !!!
   - use a file and filecard to deburr rough edges 
   - always clean collet and spindle before mounting tool 


A. Mill ends to dimension 
  - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' endmill 
  - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
  - maximum depth of cut = 0.025'' 
  - position work in vise on parallels 
  - remove parallels before machining
  - feed by hand... slow, steady feed leaves a good finish 
  - deburr when finished

B. Mill sides to dimension
   - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' endmill 
   - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
   - position vise on parallels 
   - remove paralled before machining 
   - deburr when finished
