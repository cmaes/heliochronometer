Foresight 


1. Procure Material for Foresight
   - one piece of  4'' x 1'' x 1/4'' brass plate
   - rough sawn on the band saw

2. Mill Piece to Overall Dimensions 

   Notes: 
   - measure dimension with workpiece in vice 
   - be sure operations result in mutually perpendicular edges
   - be sure cutter is rotating in proper direction 
   - do NOT run cutter into vise or parallels !!1
   - use a file and filecard to deburr rough edges 
   - always clean collet and spindle before mounting tool 


A. Mill ends to dimension 
  - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' endmill 
  - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
  - maximum depth of cut = 0.025'' 
  - position work in vise on parallels 
  - remove parallels before machining
  - feed by hand... slow, steady feed leaves a good finish 
  - deburr when finished

B. Mill sides to dimension
   - use a 3/4'' or 5/8'' endmill 
   - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM 
   - position vise on parallels 
   - remove paralled before machining 
   - deburr when finished

3. Drill sighting hole

A. Use edge-finder to locate center of edge of long side
   - use edge finder in keyless chuck to locate center 
   - clockwise rotation of milling machine handwheel will move the table AWAY from you (right hand rule)
   - stop feed once edge-finder jumps, or it will break
   - radius of edge-finder is 0.100'' 
   - spindle speed ~= 800 RPM

B. Use edge-finder to locate edge of small side 
   - same as previous stape. 
B.  Mill relief hole
   - remove edge-finder and insert 1/2'' end mill
   - spindle speed ~= 1200 RPM
   - center end mill on long side and come in .300'' from edge of small side. 
   - lock down ways 
   - Drill to depth of .200'' using knee dial

C.  Drill through hole  pinhole 
   - remove end mill and insert small collet into keyless chuck 
     and insert .023'' pinhole drill bit
   - spindle speed ~= 1400 RPM
   - do not drill into vise or parallels
