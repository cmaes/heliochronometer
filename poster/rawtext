What is a Heliochronometer?

A heliochronometer is a device for measuring \emph{standard time} via
the position of the sun. While a sundial can only tell real time 
(which can differ from mean time by as much as 17 minutes), a 
heliochoronometer contains a mechanical mechanism for converting
between real time and standard time.  This mechanical mechanism
is based on the latitude and longitude of the observer as 
well as an astronomical formula called the Equation of Time. 

The history of the Heliochronometer

The spread of the railoads in the 1880s led to Greenwich mean time
being adopted in the UK in 1880. However, the BBC did not begin
broadcasting a time signal until 1924. Thus, there was a need for a
method of accurately setting clocks and watches all over England to
Greenwich mean time. This problem was solved by the invention of the
Heliochronometer by George James Gibbs. Gibbs submitted a patent
application "Improvement in Apparatus for Indicating Mean Solar
Time" on May 8th, 1906.

No more than 1000 heliochronometer were made, and each
heliochronometer cost the equivalent of $1230 today \cite{

Design of the Heliochronometer


The design of the Heliochronometer was based on pictures of modern
heliochronometers manufactured by Aten Heliochronometers and Gunning
Sundials and design plans in Mayall.

The dial is held in the plane of the equator by two
angle blocks built for Palo Alto's latitude.

By rotating the dial and tightening the circumference
screw it is possible to make adjustments for longitutde
and daylight savings time. Since we are located in Palo
Alto, whose longitutde is 122 \circ West, and Pacific
Standard Time is based off a reference meridan of 
120 \circ West we must adjust the time back 8 minutes
or rotate the dial 2 \circ backward.
